ðŸ§  Data Analytics Portfolio â€“ AdventureWorks Projects
By: UgnÄ— BajorinienÄ—

Welcome! This repository showcases a set of projects I completed as part of my data analytics learning journey at Turing College.
Each file reflects my growing skills in SQL, Power BI, and data storytelling â€” as well as my ability to turn complex data into meaningful insights.

ðŸš´ AdventureWorks_by_Ugne_Bajoriniene.pbix
A fully interactive Power BI dashboard where I practiced:

Creating and formatting custom KPIs

Using slicers and a map to build an intuitive user experience

This project helped me improve my dashboard logic and layout to create visuals that are both insightful and user-friendly.

ðŸŽ¤ Presentations & Soft Skills Dashboard.pbix
In this project, I combined SQL-driven data exploration with storytelling and business presentation skills.

I used BigQuery to extract sales data and discovered seasonal and regional patterns in bike sales â€” focusing on touring, road, and mountain bikes. I built a Power BI dashboard and delivered two tailored presentations.

Executive Leadership Presentation (5 min)

(Sales Department Presentation coming soon)

ðŸ§¾ SQL_query_AdventureWorks.sql
This is one of the core SQL queries I developed for the dashboards. It includes:

Joins across multiple tables

Aggregation, filtering, and window functions

Use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Tailored logic to extract sales insights for business decisions

ðŸ“Š AdventureWorks Spreadsheet Overview
This earlier spreadsheet-based project helped me:

Get familiar with the AdventureWorks dataset

Use Google Sheets for cleaning, filtering, and visualizing data

Build charts and summarize insights without BI tools

ðŸ’¬ Why This Matters
These projects reflect how I combine:

ðŸ§© Curiosity and logic to uncover patterns in data

ðŸŽ¯ Clear communication to share insights that matter

ðŸ“ˆ Hands-on tools like SQL, Google Sheets, and Power BI to solve problems

I'm eager to apply these skills in real-world challenges. If you're a hiring manager, collaborator, or mentor â€” your feedback is very welcome!
