# 🧠 Data Analytics Portfolio – AdventureWorks Projects  
**By: Ugne Bajoriniene**

Welcome! This repository showcases a set of projects I completed as part of my data analytics learning journey at **Turing College**. Each file reflects my growing skills in SQL, Power BI, and data storytelling as well as my ability to turn complex data into meaningful insights.

## 🚴 AdventureWorks_by_Ugne_Bajoriniene.pbix  
**📂 [Download Dashboard (PBIX)](AdventureWorks_by_Ugne_Bajoriniene.pbix)**  
A fully interactive Power BI dashboard where I practiced:

- Creating and formatting custom KPIs  
- Using slicers and a map to build an intuitive user experience  
- Designing dashboards that are both user-friendly and insightful  

This helped me improve logic and layout for presenting business-critical information.

## 🎤 Presentations & Soft Skills Dashboard.pbix  
**📂 [Download Presentation Dashboard (PBIX)](Presentations%20%26%20Soft%20Skills%20Dashboard.pbix)**  
A project combining SQL-driven analysis and soft skills. I used BigQuery to explore product performance over time and regions, focusing on bike seasonality and categories. I then designed a 10-minute presentation tailored for the **Sales Department**.

## 🧾 SQL_query_AdventureWorks.sql  
**📂 [Download SQL Query](SQL_query_AdventureWorks.sql)**  
This is one of the core SQL queries I developed during this sprint. It demonstrates:

- Joins across multiple tables  
- Aggregation, grouping, filtering  
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)  
- Business-driven logic to prepare data for dashboarding

This earlier project helped me:

- Understand the dataset structure  
- Practice visualizations using basic charts  
- Work with spreadsheet formulas and logic without BI tools
