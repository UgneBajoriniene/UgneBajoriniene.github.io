# Data Analytics Portfolio â€“ AdventureWorks Projects  
**By: UgnÄ— BajorinienÄ—**

Welcome! This repository showcases a set of projects I completed as part of my data analytics journey at [Turing College](https://www.turingcollege.com/).  
Each file reflects my growing skills in SQL, Power BI, and data storytelling, how I turn complex data into actionable insights.

## ðŸš´ AdventureWorks_by_Ugne_Bajoriniene.pbix  

A fully interactive Power BI dashboard where I practiced:

- Creating and formatting custom KPIs  
- Using slicers and map to build an intuitive user experience  
- Improving dashboard layout and logic for better insights  

---

## ðŸŽ¤ Presentations & Soft Skills Dashboard.pbix  

In this project, I combined SQL-driven data exploration with storytelling and presentation skills.

I used BigQuery to extract sales data and discovered seasonal and regional patterns in bike sales, especially across touring, road, and mountain bikes.  
I then built a Power BI dashboard and presented my insights to a simulated Sales Department audience.

## ðŸ§¾ SQL_query_AdventureWorks.sql  

One of the core SQL queries I developed and used in my dashboard analysis. It includes:

- Joins across multiple tables  
- Aggregation and grouping  
- Use of CTEs and window functions  
- Business-focused filtering and logic

An earlier project where I:

- Explored the dataset  
- Practiced manual data cleaning and chart creation  
- Summarized insights without using BI tools

## Why This Matters  

These projects reflect how I combine:

- Curiosity and logical thinking to explore real data  
- Clear communication to share insights effectively  
- Practical tools like SQL, Google Sheets, and Power BI to deliver value  

Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and apply these skills in real-world business settings.  
If you have feedback or opportunities Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
