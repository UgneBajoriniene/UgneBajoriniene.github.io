ðŸ§  Data Analytics Portfolio â€“ AdventureWorks Projects
By: Ugne Bajoriniene

Welcome! This repository showcases a set of projects I completed as part of my data analytics learning journey at Turing College. Each file reflects my growing skills in SQL, Power BI, and data storytelling â€” as well as my ability to turn complex data into meaningful insights.

ðŸš´ AdventureWorks_by_Ugne_Bajoriniene.pbix
A fully interactive Power BI dashboard where I practiced:

Creating and formatting custom KPIs

Using slicers and map to build an intuitive user experience

This project helped me improve my design and logic in building dashboards that are both user-friendly and insightful.

ðŸŽ¤ Presentations & Soft Skills Dashboard.pbix
In this project, I combined SQL-driven data exploration with storytelling and presentation skills.

I used BigQuery to extract sales data and discovered seasonal and regional patterns in bike sales, especially across touring, road, and mountain bikes. I built a visual dashboard and turned it into a 10-minute Sales Department presentation.

ðŸ§¾ SQL_query_AdventureWorks.sql
One of the core SQL queries I developed and used in the dashboard project. It includes:

Joins across multiple tables

Aggregation and grouping

Window functions

Temporary table (CTE) creation

Business-focused filtering and logic.

This earlier project helped me:

Get familiar with the dataset

Use Google Sheets to clean, filter, and visualize sales data

Practice chart building and data summarization without BI tools

ðŸ’¬ Why This Matters
These projects reflect how I combine:

ðŸ§© Curiosity and logic to find patterns in data

ðŸŽ¯ Communication skills to share insights clearly

ðŸ“ˆ Practical tools like SQL, spreadsheets, and Power BI to deliver value

Iâ€™m eager to continue learning and take on real-world data challenges,so if you have any thoughts, feedback, or opportunities, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
