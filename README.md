ðŸ§  Data Analytics Portfolio â€“ AdventureWorks Projects
By: UgnÄ— BajorinienÄ—

Welcome! This repository showcases a set of projects I completed as part of my data analytics journey at Turing College.
Each file reflects my growing skills in SQL, Power BI, and data storytelling â€” and how I turn complex data into actionable insights.

ðŸš´ AdventureWorks_by_Ugne_Bajoriniene.pbix
A fully interactive Power BI dashboard where I practiced:

Creating and formatting custom KPIs

Using slicers and a map for intuitive filtering

Designing visuals that are both insightful and user-friendly

ðŸŽ¤ Presentations & Soft Skills Dashboard.pbix
In this project, I combined SQL-driven data exploration with storytelling and presentation skills.
Using BigQuery, I extracted sales data to analyze regional and seasonal trends in bike sales, including touring, road, and mountain bikes.

I built a Power BI dashboard and created a 10-minute presentation for the Sales Department, focused on stabilizing growth through deeper product-seasonality understanding.

ðŸ§¾ SQL_query_AdventureWorks.sql
A key SQL query I developed during analysis. It includes:

Joins across multiple tables

Use of CTEs, aggregations, and window functions

Filters designed for business-relevant results

ðŸ“Š AdventureWorks Spreadsheet Overview
An earlier project using Google Sheets to:

Explore the dataset

Practice manual data cleaning and chart creation

Summarize insights without BI tools

ðŸ’¬ Why This Matters
These projects reflect how I combine:

ðŸ§© Curiosity and logical thinking to spot trends and outliers

ðŸŽ¯ Clear communication to tell a story behind the numbers

ðŸ“ˆ Practical tools â€” SQL, spreadsheets, and Power BI â€” to deliver value

Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and apply these skills in real business settings.
If you have feedback, questions, or opportunities â€” Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
